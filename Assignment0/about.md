ii.		I have two years of classes and some personal experience with programming. All C# programming experience is
		non-school related. My only git experience is from my capstone course (COS420 Objected-Oriented Design).

iii.	I enjoy working on my own personal programming projects in my spare time, which includes the use of Java
		and C++. I also am interested in musical instruments and building electronics.

iv.		I am interested in software development, although I am currently working in Quality Assurance at MEMIC, so my
		career interests are a bit flexible at the moment.

v.		I am open to anything new, and as it stands I could use some practice with C#.

vi.		I prefer a hands on approach with a focus on applying skills as I learn them. I Usually prefer to work on 
		projects in the comfort of my own home.

vii.	Nothing currently comes to mind.
